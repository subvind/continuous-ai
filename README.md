# Continuous-AI

Continuous-AI is an HTMX/NestJS/TypeScript-based Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery system for managing AI-generated apps.

## Overview

Continuous-AI aims to streamline the process of developing, testing, and deploying AI-generated applications. By leveraging the power of HTMX for dynamic HTML updates, NestJS for a robust backend, and TypeScript for type-safe code, this system provides a comprehensive solution for managing the lifecycle of AI-generated applications.

## Features

- Seamless integration with AI code generation tools
- Automated testing and validation of AI-generated code
- Continuous integration pipeline for smooth development workflow
- Continuous delivery system for efficient deployment
- Real-time updates and monitoring of application status
- User-friendly interface for managing multiple AI-generated projects

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/continuous-ai.git
cd continuous-ai
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

### Development Mode

To run the application in development mode with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

### Production Mode

To build and run the application in production mode:
